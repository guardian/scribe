# Feature Development
* Remove event listeners, emit unbind to plugins so that can too
* Config for nesting elements
* Transactions for commands and undo manager


# Outstanding Patches
* Chrome and Firefox: Bold command uses B node instead of STRONG
* Chrome: Indenting/outdenting lists for nesting


# Disabled Things Which Should Be Enabled
* `blockquote` command when caret is in a list


# To Investigate
* Buttons do not update the instance they are clicked. You have to start typing.


# Known Bugs
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE, add list, unapply blockquote = Creates BLOCKQUOTE
  without P.
* An item is pushed to the undo manager every time an empty editor is emptied.

# Bugs caused by Selection.placeMarkers
* Chrome: Insert list with at least 2 list items, <select all>, <backspace> =
  Creates two orphan list items
  - This is caused by Selection.placeMarkers adding a redundant text node after
    the inserted end marker.
* When applying the link command to an existing link, it does not clean up old
  A elements. This has been temporarily fixed by disabling the command when the
  selection contains an A element. (http://jsbin.com/AkasOzu/3/edit?html,js,console,output)
* When executing the remove format command, sometimes the selected inline
  elements remain. Related to the bug above (caused by inserting markers).


# Fixed
* Chrome: Add H1, <enter> = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add empty LI, <enter> = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add LI, unapply list = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE = Nests BLOCKQUOTE inside of P
